      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m Fernando Avalos, a 23-year-old Product Engineer at a startup.
        But beyond my day job, I’m deeply passionate about something I believe
        could shape the future: <strong>AI Safety</strong>. <br />
        <br />
        I’m not an expert (yet), but I’m all-in when it comes to learning and
        making a difference. In fact, I’m a{' '}
        <strong>
          co-founder and organizer of{' '}
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-safety-col/?viewAsMember=true">
            AI Safety Colombia
          </a>
        </strong>
        , where we bring together people who care about ensuring that the
        development of artificial intelligence benefits humanity in a safe and
        responsible way. <br />
        <br />
        It’s an exciting and complex space, with a lot of unknowns. While I’m
        constantly learning, my focus is on helping build awareness and
        encouraging thoughtful conversations around AI’s long-term impact. AI is
        powerful, but with power comes risk — and I believe that managing this
        risk responsibly is one of the most important challenges of our time.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey in AI Safety has just begun, but I’m driven to contribute
        wherever I can, from organizing discussions to collaborating with
        researchers and enthusiasts. If you’re interested in AI Safety or just
        want to chat about the future of AI, feel free to reach out. Let’s make
        sure we’re building something that not only works but lasts.
